# Linkes List

## The program
This is a program I developed in order to understand better Linked List. There is a List Data Structure in C++ and you can use it with its function (insert...) but it's always good to know how something works.


## The code
This code is written in C++.
Two classes were created in order to create a Linked List : a Node Class and a Linked List Class.

The Node Class:
1) Properties:
- a node has a value
- a node has a pointer pointing to the next element
2) Methods:
- a constructor

The Linked List Class:
1) Properties:
- a pointer to the head
- a pointer to the tail
2) Methods:
- a constructor
- a function to add a node at the beginning
- a function to add a node at the end
- a function to delete a node
- a function to print the linked list
- a function to merge two linked lists
